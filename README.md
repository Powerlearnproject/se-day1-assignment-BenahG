#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

It is the discipline of designing, developin, testing and maintaining software applications through systematic, structured and standardized processes.
It's importance in the technology industry is that it enables the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life including communication, commerce, entertainment, and healthcare.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Milestones include the development of programming languages (e.g., Fortran, C), the establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s, the advent of structured programming in the 1970s, and the rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s.




List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
a. Requirements: Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
b. Design: Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
c. Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to design specifications.
d. Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
e. Deployment: Releasing the software to users or customers.
f. Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall: sequential approach with distinct phases flowing downwards like a waterfall. A scenario is like: Developing a software for a government agency where the requirements are rigid, and documation is necessary for compliance with regulations. While,
Agile: Iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration, and responding to change. A scenario is like:Developing a mobile app a startup where the market demands and user preferences are rapidly changing.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
a. Software Developer: Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
b. Quality Assuarance Engineer: ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
c. Project manager: Oversees the planning, execution and delivery of software projects.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs: Software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code. For example, Visual Studio, Eclipse.
VCS: Software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members. For example, Git, Subversion.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
a. Changing Requirements: Requirements may change during the development cycle, leading to scope creep and project delays.
b. Tight deadlines: Pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality.
c. Technical debt: Accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions, technical debt can impede future development efforts and increase maintenance costs.

Strategies for overcoming challenges include: effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks, and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

a.  Unit Testing: Testing individual components or modules of software.
b. Integration Testing: Testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
c. System Testing: Testing the entire software system as a whole.
d. Acceptance Testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.

Quality control measures such as code reviews, automated testing, and continuous integration help identify and fix defects early in the development process, leading to higher-quality software products.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
prompt engineering is all about crafting your questions or instructions in a way that helps get the best responses from your robot or AI assistant

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

vague prompt: “Who do you want to know about technology”?
improved: "Explain the impact of artificial intelligence on the healthcare industry in the past five years."
the improved prompt is clear, specific, and concise. It directs the AI to focus on "artificial intelligence," a particular area of technology, and its "impact on the healthcare industry" over a specific time frame ("in the past five years"). This narrowing of scope ensures that the AI provides a relevant and targeted response, making it more effective for the user’s needs.
